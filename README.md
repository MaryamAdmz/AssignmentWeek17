### Comparing Classifiers
This project compares the performance of four classifiers: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree,
and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use a dataset related to the marketing of bank products conducted via 
telephone, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The data comes from a Portuguese banking institution and contains the results of multiple marketing campaigns.
It includes customer information, campaign details, and whether the client subscribed to a term deposit.
For a detailed description of the dataset and its features, we reference the accompanying research article
provided in the repository.
